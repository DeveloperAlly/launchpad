## Distributed Networking Solutions

#### [The Modular p2p Networking Stack | ResNetLabs On Tour – Alfonso de la Rocha](https://research.protocol.ai/tutorials/resnetlab-on-tour/modular-p2p-stack/)

libp2p is the Web 3.0 framework of choice for decentralized process addressing. In this module, you will hear about libp2p’s modular and composable building blocks for P2P networking applications and innovation, which include:

* Transport and pubsub protocols
* Multiplexers
* Secure channels and NAT Traversal
* Peer discovery, content routing, and peer routing
